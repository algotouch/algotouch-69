# Docs AGENTS.md

## Scope

Project guides, standards, and deep-dives in `/docs`.

---

## Guidelines

- Update docs when flows, architecture, or standards change
- Use clear Markdown: headings, lists, code blocks
- Document decisions, rationales, gotchas
 - New docs: create descriptive filenames (e.g. `PERFORMANCE.md`, `REACT_PROFILING.md`, `GLOBAL_ERROR_HANDLING.md`)
- Cross-link AGENTS.md, CODE_STANDARDS.md, etc., where helpful

---

## Docs Are:

- For patterns, architecture, performance, onboarding, style
- Not for secrets, credentials, or implementation-specific notes (put those in code comments)

---

## Agent Workflow

- Always update docs as part of big features, refactors, or migrations
- If you learn a pitfall, document it here

---

**If docs and code/AGENTS.md ever conflict, update both so they match!**
